## ✅ What Users Can Do Right Now

### 1. Find Admin Users (PRIMARY USE CASE)
```bash
./build/aws-access-map who-can "*" --action "*"
# ✅ Works perfectly
```

### 2. Collect IAM Data
```bash
./build/aws-access-map collect
# ✅ Collects users, roles, policies in 2-3 seconds
```

### 3. Inspect Collected Data
```bash
jq '.Principals[] | {Name, Type, PolicyCount: (.Policies | length)}' aws-access-data.json
# ✅ Full JSON export for analysis
```

### 4. Multi-Account/Profile Support
```bash
./build/aws-access-map collect --profile prod
# ✅ Works with AWS profiles
```

### 5. Query Specific Permissions
```bash
./build/aws-access-map who-can "arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*" --action "s3:*"
# ⚠️  Works but wildcard matching is simplified
```

---

## ⚠️  Known Limitations (Documented)

### 1. Wildcard Matching
**Issue:** Only exact match or `*` suffix (e.g., `s3:Get*`)
**Impact:** A user with `Action: "*"` won't be found when querying `s3:GetObject`
**Workaround:** Query for `"*"` to find all admins
**Status:** Documented in README, TESTING.md

### 2. Experimental Commands
**path:** Scaffolded but not fully implemented
**report:** Returns empty results
**Status:** Marked [EXPERIMENTAL] and [COMING SOON] in help text

### 3. No Resource Policies
**Issue:** S3, KMS, SQS bucket policies not collected
**Impact:** Can't detect resource-based access grants
**Status:** Documented in README roadmap

### 4. No Condition Evaluation
**Issue:** Policy conditions not evaluated
**Impact:** May report access blocked by conditions
**Status:** Documented in limitations

---

## 📊 Testing Results

### Real AWS Account Testing
- ✅ Account: 571667117138
