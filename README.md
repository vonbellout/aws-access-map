## Why This Exists

You're debugging a permissions issue at 2am. A contractor's last day is tomorrow. A security audit is due Friday. You need to know **right now**:

- "Who has admin access to our AWS account?"
- "Can this Lambda role access our production database?"
- "Did that developer's permissions get fully revoked?"
- "Which services can decrypt our KMS key?"

**The current options are painful:**
- AWS Console IAM Policy Simulator: Clunky UI, one-at-a-time checks, no role chains
- `aws iam` CLI commands: Need to write complex jq pipelines, manually parse policies
- Commercial tools: Heavyweight, expensive, UI-first, require agents/scanning
- Manual review: Error-prone, time-consuming, miss transitive access

**aws-access-map solves this:** CLI-first, fast, open-source, answers in seconds.

## What It Does

Builds a graph of your AWS permissions and answers questions like:

```bash
# Who has god-mode access?
aws-access-map who-can "*" --action "*"

# Can this role access the production database?
aws-access-map path --from arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/Lambda --to arn:aws:rds:...:db/prod --action rds:Connect

# Which users can read secrets?
aws-access-map who-can "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret/prod/*" --action secretsmanager:GetSecretValue

# Security audit: find all admin users
aws-access-map report --high-risk
```

**Handles complex AWS permission model:**
- Identity-based policies (inline + managed)
- Resource policies (S3, KMS, SQS, SNS, Secrets Manager)
- Role trust policies and assumption chains
- Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- Permission boundaries
- Resource-based grants

## Installation

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pfrederiksen/aws-access-map
cd aws-access-map
make build
./build/aws-access-map --help
```

### Pre-built Binaries
Download from [releases](https://github.com/pfrederiksen/aws-access-map/releases) (coming soon).

### Go Install
```bash
go install github.com/pfrederiksen/aws-access-map/cmd/aws-access-map@latest
```

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** AWS credentials configured (environment variables, `~/.aws/credentials`, or IAM role).

```bash
# 1. Collect IAM data from your AWS account (takes ~2-3 seconds)
aws-access-map collect --output my-account.json

# 2. Find who has admin access
aws-access-map who-can "*" --action "*"

# Example output:
# Found 1 principal(s) with access:
#   alice (user)
#     ARN: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/alice
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Security Audit: Who Has Admin Access?

**Scenario:** Your security team needs to audit who has full AWS access.

```bash
aws-access-map who-can "*" --action "*"
```

**What it checks:**
- Users/roles with `AdministratorAccess` managed policy
- Custom policies with `"Action": "*", "Resource": "*"`
- Policies with broad wildcards

### Offboarding: Verify Access Revoked

**Scenario:** A contractor left. You removed their IAM user, but did they have any service roles?

```bash
# Check if any roles have trust policies allowing their account
aws-access-map collect
grep "contractor-account-id" aws-access-data.json
```

### Debugging: Why Can't Lambda Access S3?

**Scenario:** Your Lambda function is getting Access Denied on S3.

```bash
# Check if the Lambda role can access the bucket
aws-access-map path \
  --from arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyLambdaRole \
  --to arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/* \
  --action s3:GetObject

# If no path found, you know the permissions are missing
```

### Compliance: Find Overly Permissive Roles

**Scenario:** Security audit flagged potential over-privileged service accounts.

```bash
aws-access-map report --high-risk

# Look for:
# - Roles with Action: "*"
# - Cross-account trust relationships
# - Public access to resources
```

### Incident Response: Blast Radius Analysis

**Scenario:** A key was exposed. What can it access?

```bash
# If it's an IAM user access key
aws-access-map who-can "*" --action "*" | grep exposed-user

# Check what they can reach
aws-access-map collect
# Parse the collected data to see all their policies
```

## Commands

### `collect`
Fetch IAM data from your AWS account and save it locally.

```bash
aws-access-map collect [--output FILE] [--profile PROFILE] [--region REGION]

# Examples:
aws-access-map collect                              # Saves to aws-access-data.json
aws-access-map collect --output prod-account.json   # Custom filename
aws-access-map collect --profile prod               # Use specific AWS profile
```

**What it collects:**
- ✅ IAM users (with inline and managed policies)
- ✅ IAM roles (with trust policies and permissions)
- ✅ IAM groups (coming soon)
- ⏳ S3 bucket policies (roadmap)
- ⏳ KMS key policies (roadmap)
- ⏳ Service Control Policies (roadmap)

### `who-can`
Find all principals that can perform an action on a resource.

```bash
aws-access-map who-can RESOURCE --action ACTION [--profile PROFILE]

# Examples:
aws-access-map who-can "*" --action "*"                         # Find admins
aws-access-map who-can "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*" --action "s3:GetObject"
aws-access-map who-can "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:*:key/*" --action "kms:Decrypt"
```

**Current behavior:**
- ✅ Queries identity-based policies (IAM users/roles)
- ✅ Full wildcard matching (supports `*`, `s3:Get*`, `iam:*User*`, etc.)
- ⏳ Resource-based policies not yet supported
- ⏳ Condition evaluation not yet supported

### `path`
Discover access paths from one principal to a resource.

```bash
aws-access-map path --from PRINCIPAL --to RESOURCE --action ACTION

# Examples:
aws-access-map path \
  --from arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyLambda \
  --to arn:aws:s3:::sensitive-bucket/* \
  --action s3:GetObject
```

**Current behavior:**
- ✅ Finds direct access paths
- ⏳ Role assumption chains not yet implemented
- ⏳ Multi-hop paths (User → Role A → Role B → Resource) coming soon

### `report`
Generate security reports highlighting high-risk access patterns.

```bash
aws-access-map report [--account ACCOUNT_ID] [--high-risk]

# Example:
aws-access-map report --high-risk
```

**Current behavior:**
- ⏳ Report generation not yet implemented
- Planned findings: admin access, public resources, cross-account trust, etc.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌───────┐
│ Collect │ -> │ Graph │ -> │ Query │
└─────────┘    └───────┘    └───────┘
     │             │             │
  AWS APIs    In-memory    Traverse &
  (IAM, S3,    Structure     Answer
   KMS, etc)   (Nodes +
               Edges)
```

**1. Collect** - Fetches data via AWS SDK:
- IAM users, roles, groups
- Inline policies (attached directly)
- Managed policies (AWS or custom)
- Trust policies (who can assume roles)
- Resource policies (S3, KMS, etc.) - coming soon

**2. Build Graph** - Parses policies into a graph:
- **Nodes**: Principals (users, roles), Resources (S3 buckets, KMS keys), Actions
- **Edges**: Permissions (Principal → Action → Resource), Trust (Principal → Role)
- **Attributes**: Allow/Deny effect, conditions, policy type

**3. Query** - Traverses the graph to find answers:
- Direct access: "Does user X have permission Y?"
- Reverse lookup: "Who can perform action Y?"
- Path finding: "How can principal X reach resource Z?"
- Risk analysis: "What has public access?" (coming soon)

## Current Status

**✅ Working**
- Collect IAM users and roles from AWS
- Parse inline and managed policies
- Build in-memory permission graph
- Query direct access (`who-can` command)
- Handle basic wildcards (`*` and simple prefixes like `s3:Get*`)

**⚠️  Limitations (MVP)**
- ✅ Full wildcard matching implemented (glob patterns)
- Policy conditions are not evaluated
- No resource-based policies yet (S3, KMS, etc.)
- Role assumption chains not traversed
- Single account only

**⏳ Roadmap**
- [ ] Enhanced wildcard matching (full glob patterns)
- [ ] Resource policy collection (S3, KMS, SQS, SNS, Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Transitive access via role chains
- [ ] Policy condition evaluation
- [ ] Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- [ ] Multi-account support via AWS Organizations
- [ ] Caching for faster repeat queries
- [ ] JSON output mode for scripting
- [ ] Web UI for visualization

**Key design decisions:**
- **Go** for single-binary distribution and fast execution
- **In-memory graph** for sub-second queries (good for single accounts)
- **Graph-based model** to handle transitive access naturally
- **CLI-first** design (APIs and UI come later)

## FAQ

**Q: Is this free? Are there AWS charges?**
A: ✅ **100% free.** The software is open source (MIT license) and IAM API calls have no charge in AWS. See [COST.md](COST.md) for detailed breakdown. When we add S3/KMS collection, costs are negligible (<$0.05 per run).

**Q: Does this require special permissions?**
A: It needs read-only IAM permissions (`iam:Get*`, `iam:List*`). Recommended: AWS managed `SecurityAudit` policy. The tool is completely read-only and cannot modify your AWS resources.

**Q: Is my data sent anywhere?**
A: No. Everything runs locally on your machine. Data is only fetched from AWS and stored in a local JSON file. No telemetry, no cloud services, no third parties.

**Q: How often should I run `collect`?**
A: Depends on how frequently your IAM policies change. Daily for active accounts, weekly for stable ones. Each run is free, so run as often as you need.

**Q: Can I use this in CI/CD?**
A: Yes! Use `collect` then `who-can` to validate that new deployments don't grant unintended permissions. It's fast (3 seconds) and free to run on every build.

**Q: What AWS regions does it support?**
A: IAM is global, so region doesn't matter. The tool defaults to `us-east-1` for API calls. For resource policies (S3, KMS), you'll need to specify the region.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by the pain of debugging AWS permissions at 2am. Built because existing tools were too slow, too expensive, or too complicated.

Special thanks to the AWS IAM team for creating such a... comprehensive... permission model. 😅
